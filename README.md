# Communication Networks
Developed Custom Network Topologies in Mininet and Basic HTTP Server in Python

# Wireshark
Captured and Analyzed HTTP Packets:
- Simple GET Request and Response
- Conditional GET Request using Local Cache
- Long Documents Segmented in Multiple TCP Streams
- Embeded Objects over Multiple HTTP Requests from Different Servers
- Authentication Request and Response with and without Authorization 

Traced DNS Queries:
- Surfing Ordinary Web Activity
- W/ Local DNS Server
- W/ Specified DNS Server
- DNS Caching ... 
- DNS Records and Messages
- Type A for IPv4 Addresses
- Type NS for Authoritative Nameserver

# Networking Tools
- Query DNS Server using Local Default DNS Server with nslookup
- View TCP/IP and DNS Information on Local Computer with ipconfig/ifconfig

# Mininet
- Introduced to Basic Mininet Topologies
> mn --topo single,10
> mn --topo reversed,10
> mn --topo linear,10
> mn --topo tree,2
- Generated Custom Topology in Python

# Socket Programming 
- Create TCP Sockets
- Parse Requests 
- Generate and Send Responses
- Create HTTP Channel
